# CPP-Course Projects
Some C\+\+ / SDL2 games, wich are programmed during the C\+\+ Course in the University "Freie Universit√§t Berlin".
Included are three projects:
- A pacman clone
- A "Space" Game where the player flies a space shit throug the stars with paralax scrolling to simulate depth
- A Sidescroller game, wich is a self invented game. It was the proof that we had learned the necessary skills to write a program in c++ to pass the course.

## Build
The projects are depending on SDL2, SDL2_image (to display images), SDL2_ttf (to display text) and SDL2_mixer (to play sound).
All projects are CMake Projects. So, to build the projects you just have to run "cmake" in the specific folder and "make" afterwards.
